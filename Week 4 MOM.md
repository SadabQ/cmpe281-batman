#Week 4

Work done: Productivity was a little down beacuse of the auspicios festival of Diwali. However, the group was able to achieve certain milestones. We  were able to run certain databases on AWS and had done research to create clusters of the databases.

Plan for next week: We will create clusters of the databases and perform CRUD on data from the cluster of databases. We will also start to design the application APIs.

Discussed on the applicatiom workflow with the team.
Progessed on the hign level architecture of user level activity log.

Blocker: One of the blocker is the lack of official documentaion of Riak database. It was later found from github.
