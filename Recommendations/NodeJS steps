Download node and npm.
Check for the versions of node and npm:
$ node -v
v8.5.0
$ npm -v
5.3.0
Creating project skeleton
$ cd ~/Recommendation/Codes
$ mkdir RecommendationEngine
$ cd RecommendationEngine

Create a package.json file and save into this folder. Contents of package.json are in the attached package.json file in the RecommendationEngine folder.

Create app.js in the same folder as package.json
Go to the path that contains app.js and package.json and say:
$npm install
this installs all the dependency modules.
TO start the app, say:
Node app.js
Neo4j has already been installed (dockerized). We can connect to neo4j from our Nodejs in 2 ways.
1.	Using the Neo4j javascript driver. Or,
2.	Using HTTP call only.
Lets follow the 2nd approach. For this, we need to have ‘request’ module into our node-modules. Either go to node-modules folder and say :
$ npm install request. Or, 
Update the package.json, add:
“request” : “*”
and again say npm install.
