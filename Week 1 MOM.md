What did the team do the past week? We decided to divide the various technologies that are to be expected in out project and researched them. The Kanban chart has been set and Google sheets for monitoring of various metrics is in place.

What is the team going to do next week? We will be starting the design for the system architecture and will make a decision on the product catalog. This will provide more clarity for the product's final form.

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing? The most database technologies are new to all the team members and the learning curve is pretty steep. Lack of this sound technical understanding is making it difficult to have a clear vision for the project's final form.
