XP Core Value - Respect

Week1: It was the Team introduction and collective project goThrough period. All members gave their input on their understanding of the project requirement and built a consensus of opinion.

Week2: Last meeting came up with no mutual perceptions for a few architecture. The team participated with patience and came out with mutual consent.

Week3: Team worked together to come up with finalizing the technology stack and the architecture.

Week4: Kickoff for work and teams started with implementation

Week5: Discussed the progress of individual work and helped members with better implementation ideas that were happily accepted with justifying feasibility.

Week6: One of our backend was started with a technology where we had showstopper and we discussed for the possible solution and came around with a mutual consent to stick with the same backend technology as earlier it was planned to switch to other.

Week7: There were some notion mismatch for the frontend part in the team, we gave an ear to every person's notions and came up with AngularJS and ExpressJS collaboratively. Thus, we maintained the respect decorum and came to a mutual consent.
