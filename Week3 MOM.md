#Week 3 

Work done: We have researched MongoDB, Cassandra and other NoSQL databases. A archicture of the system was proposed and dicussed. Also, we decided to use Node.js to develop backend services.

Plan for next week: We will link the databases to an applicaiton framework and then demonstrate adding to it, fetching from it and deleting from it.

Blocker: Unfamiliarity and inexperience with NoSQL and API development had slowed the progress.
