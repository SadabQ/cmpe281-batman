#WEEK 1 I am advocating Communication. I am tasked with promoting the value of robust communication in the project team. For achieving more productive communication, I proposed the use of the popular work space communication app, "Slack". This has been a complete failure since not all members have even signed up for slack and all of the communication still happens on WhattsApp, I am hopeful that as the project progresses, I would be able to convince the team about the merits of using Slack and thus will yield in more productive environment. Not using slacks, mixes project communication with casual chats and then degrades important project communication to just chats. In group meetings I have advocated for use of the Kanban board for clearly communicating the details of the issues and their description. I make sure that no issue discussed in the meeting was left out of the Kanban board. I understand that transparency is very important of an Agile project to succeed and communication is an important part of it. My target for the next week is to have a daily conversation about the project progress on Slack so that it would become easy to implement Scrum in the second half of the project.

#WEEK 2 The team's communication was robust. All members were comfortably able to interact with each other regarding their concerns. Slack was still not used for project communication. The Kanban board was used for this week to clearly communicate the tasks assigned to individuals and all the problems were dealt with.

#WEEK 3 This week the communication via GitHub based project Kanban board was plenty sufficient. Everyone was able to decide on the issues and were assigned issues accordingly. The new phase of design patterns is starting in the project. This will also mean more ingeration tasks will come up. I forcast that the task of maintaining good communicaiton lines will increase and I will have to work harder to keep track that the team members are effectively speaking to each other.

#WEEK 4 Because of Diwali, many team members were not available throught the week, including myself. However, because of modern technological communication tools, like whattsapp and email, all group members were in touch. We were able to do some real progress despite of the festive season. In the comming week, we will start to integrate our works. We will have to create our API. This will require effective communicaiton among the group members.

#WEEK 5 This week we did scrum. Scrum is a framework for managing software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work into actions that can be completed within fixed duration cycles (called "sprints"), track progress and re-plan in daily 15-minute stand-up meetings, and collaborate to deliver workable software every sprint.

#WEEK 6 This week was a scare. The entire team tried to run the Riak's client application and was not able to successfully CRUD it. So, we decided to use Project Voldemort instead. Project Voldemort is alsa an AP key value database and thus would be a proper replacement for Riak. However, upon more research, we found that it hasn't been updated since 2014. So, I gave another run at Riak and was able to run the sample Riak client NodeJs Application.
