Feedback is my XP core value.

Week 1: During the first meet, we performed one of the crucial responsibilities of the feedback group i.e. the planning game. We set weekly project goals and terms of final product delivery that will be reviewed for feedback in the coming weeks. The main idea of planning game is to share planning responsibilities between the team.

We created high level user stories and prioritized them.
We identified individual responsibilities within the team.
