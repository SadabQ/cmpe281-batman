#Week 8

Work done: -Integration of all of our server side applicaitons was started.
	   -We realized that we are going to need DBworkers and a message broker, so as to prevent our application from breaking down.
	   -We starting working on the caching strategy for redis.
	   -Front End framework was decides upon and work in that was progressed further.
	   
Plan for next week:-
	We are going to finish our integration. Then, we will decide our testing strategy and do unit and regression testing. We hope to find as many bugs as we can and write patches for that. We are also going to refactor our code and hope to be able to finish the product in time.

Blocker: We are in overtime and thus we wish to finish the project as soon as possible.
