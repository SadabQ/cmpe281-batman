#Week 3 

Work done: We have researched MongoDB, Cassandra and other NoSQL databases. A architecture of the system was proposed and discussed. Also, we decided to use Node.js to develop backend services instead of using JAVA Frameworks.
Also for now, we decided on the domain to create an website like Amazon, where products will be from one store unlike Google Express.

Plan for next week: We will link the databases to an applicaiton framework and then demonstrate adding to it, fetching from it and deleting from it.

Blocker: Unfamiliarity and inexperience with NoSQL and API development had slowed the progress.
