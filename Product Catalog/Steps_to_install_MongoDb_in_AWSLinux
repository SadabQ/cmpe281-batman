Setting Up the Single test instance EC2 server for installing mongo-db:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installing Mongo-db:
	a.Make a pachage in : /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.0.repo
	b.Use the following repo file :
			[mongodb-org-3.0]
			name=MongoDB Repository
			baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2013.03/mongodb-org/3.0/x86_64/
			gpgcheck=0
			enabled=1 
	c.Use this to install the latest version : sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
	d.In the /etc/yum.conf file add this: exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools
	   to exclude the auto update using yum.
	e.The MongoDB instance stores its data files in /var/lib/mongo and its log files in /var/log/mongodb by default, and runs using the mongod user account	
	f.To start the service use: sudo service mongod start

2. Create and configure amazon ec2 Instance:
	a.Create a VPC in Amazon in US East (N. Virgina) and configure it.
	b.Attach Internet-gateway to it.
	c.Attach subnets, and routes and configure it.
	d.Launch an ec2 instance into the VPC and configure the ports, and open 27017(the default port for mongo-db)
	e.SSH into the instance.

3. Steps to Open port 27017 on EC2 instance:
	a. Go to your EC2 dashboard: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
	b. Go to Instances and scroll down to see your instanceâ€™s Security Groups. Eg, it will be something like launch-wizard-4
	c. Go to Netword & Security -> Security Groups -> Inbound tab -> Edit button.
	d. Make a new Custom TCP on port 27017, Source: Anywhere, 0.0.0.0/0

4. Configuring Mongo-db configuration file for the remote connection:
	a.In the /etc/mongo.conf file comment out the line #bind 127.0.0.1 to take the connections from anywhere.
	b.Restart the service using : sudo service mongod restart.
	c.verify that mongo-db has started successfully by going to /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log and check for the line 
	  waiting for connections on port 27017
	d.Use this command to start the service automatically when system reboots: sudo chkconfig mongod on


5.Verifying the mongo-db remote connection:
	a.Make a test database in mongo db using : use cmpe281
	b.Add data to the collection: db.cmpe281.insert({"a":1})
	c.Add a user for this database using the following code:
		use test
		db.createUser(
    		{
      			user: "suchi",
     	 		pwd: "1234",
      			roles: [
         		{ role: "readWrite", db: "test" }
     		 	]
   	 	}
		)
