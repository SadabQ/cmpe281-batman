### Feedback is my XP core value.

Week 1: During the first meet, we performed one of the crucial responsibilities of the feedback group i.e. the planning game. We set weekly project goals and terms of final product delivery that will be reviewed for feedback in the coming weeks. The main idea of planning game is to share planning responsibilities between the team.

  We created high level user stories and prioritized them.
  We identified individual responsibilities within the team.

Week 2: During the second meet, we discussed about the progress made by each team member in each track, and discussed about the challenges we faced, and what could be done to fix those problems. 
We reprioritized the high level user stories and discussed different approaches to solve a problem. 
After collecting feedback from all, we decided to create a small POC(a small working model) in our local system and then expand our database to add more products and scale it to cater to multiple users.


Week 3: During the third meet, I got feedback from all members regarding the technology we are going to use in designing our backend services and after intensive discussion we decided to use Node.js instead of Java frameworks.
