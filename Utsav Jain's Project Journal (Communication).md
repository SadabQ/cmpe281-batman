#WEEK 1 I am advocating Communication. I am tasked with promoting the value of robust communication in the project team. For achieving more productive communication, I proposed the use of the popular work space communication app, "Slack". This has been a complete failure since not all members have even signed up for slack and all of the communication still happens on WhattsApp, I am hopeful that as the project progresses, I would be able to convince the team about the merits of using Slack and thus will yield in more productive environment. Not using slacks, mixes project communication with casual chats and then degrades important project communication to just chats. In group meetings I have advocated for use of the Kanban board for clearly communicating the details of the issues and their description. I make sure that no issue discussed in the meeting was left out of the Kanban board. I understand that transparency is very important of an Agile project to succeed and communication is an important part of it. My target for the next week is to have a daily conversation about the project progress on Slack so that it would become easy to implement Scrum in the second half of the project.

#WEEK 2 The team's communication was robust. All members were comfortably able to interact with each other regarding their concerns. Slack was still not used for project communication. The Kanban board was used for this week to clearly communicate the tasks assigned to individuals and all the problems were dealt with.
